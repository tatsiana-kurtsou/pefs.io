Latest [PEFS](http://pefs.io/) release (2016.06.11) includes a number of significant performance and stability improvements. Among them:

- Shared vnode locking support which greatly improves performance
- Refactored internal directory cache subsystem with improved performance
- New configuration option for per file system hash table instead of global one
- Fixed race condition in kernel FPU context allocation
- Fixed buffer invalidation for inactive vnodes. 

Shared vnode locking made it possible to fully utilize underling file system and “in real life” workloads,  while previous PEFS versions did not support concurrent read access to files and directories. Dircache has also been refactored to eliminate lock contention and facilitate concurrent access. FPU races that could have potentially resulted in the cryptographic operations slowdown were fixed in current release. These improvements proved to be most useful in multi-user server environment.
