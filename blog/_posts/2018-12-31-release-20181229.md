title: Release 2018.12.29
---

[PEFS](http://pefs.io/) release 2018.12.29 fixes build issues in FreeBSD 13-CURRENT; workaround for LazyFPU security bug.


PEFS was negatively affected by LazyFPU remediation changes for a two month period in June -- July of 2018.
FreeBSD kernel issue was discovered by PEFS team and promptly addressed.
Workaround was committed on [July 19](https://github.com/glk/pefs/commit/ab0155960d66aee95dff0c1cf611a6987034dc65)
before official FreeBSD security advisory publication.

Official FreeBSD security advisory [FreeBSD-EN-18:08.lazyfpu.asc](https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-EN-18:08.lazyfpu.asc)
was published to address the issue:
> As a result of fixing the issue described in SA-18:07.lazyfpu, a regression
> was introduced.  FPU state manipulation did not sufficiently prevent context
> switches potentially allowing partially modified FPU context to be switched
> out.  Upon returning the thread to a running state, stale FPU context could
> be reloaded.

Additionally, several build fixes were made earlier this year:
- [PR 234250](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=234250)
- [PR 233882](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=233882)
- [PR 233242](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=233242)
